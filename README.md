This repo contains two examples of the work I undertook during my class on graphic design. Unfortunately I did not save more of it, but I feel that these are a solid representation of my competency. Both were made in Adobe illustrator.

"Project 1" is a business card and letter head.

"Project 2" is an infographic about NFTs.
